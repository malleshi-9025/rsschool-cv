## About myself

My disadvantages include the fact that very often I approach tasks in a non-standard way, which leads to a loss of time. My advantages include the fact that usually sooner or later I achieve the goal.

Recently, I've started to pay a lot of attention to self-organization and standardization of methods of interaction with the world. So I hope that I will be able to complete tasks on time and in the right way.

Also I'm not a team player due to lack of experience, but I want to be the one of them.

def find_nb(m):
    counter = 0
    while m > 0:
        counter += 1
        m -= counter**3
    if m < 0:
        return -1
    else:
        return counter
